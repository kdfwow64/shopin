        "question": "You announced your partnership with iExec in a January 11, 2018 press release, enabling Shopin to scale consumer DAPPs [Distributed Applications] to more than 1MM transactions per second. Will you give it out for free? (Blockchain)",
        "answer": "Yes, quite a milestone for the entire crypto community! We will share our code with the Ethereum community for free."
    }, {
        "question": "Why is Shopin giving the solution away for free? (Blockchain)",
        "answer": "Because it’s not a part of our core business model, and more importantly, no single entity should own this tech. If everybody is able to run consumer-grade applications on Ethereum at more than 1 million transactions per second, then we all benefit and more solutions are adopted by the ecosystem. The rising tide lifts all ships. Companies should prosper based on their ability to execute, not on the lack of access to fundamental technology."
    }, {
        "question": "Does the data stay on the blockchain, unlike Raiden or Lightning where data is lost after the states channel closes? (Blockchain)",
        "answer": "Yes. The data remains on the blockchain, attestable. "
    }, {
        "question": "Can participants track Shopin Token quantities easily? (Tokenomics)",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Once we are live, sites like CoinMarketCap can track this, as well as many other sources."
    }, {
        "question": "How does the data exchange work? (Tokenomics)",
        "answer": "When you share your data through Shopin with retailers, they offer you tokens in order to better curate your experience, thus allowing you to monetize your own personal data and benefit directly from their use of it."
    }, {
        "question": "What will happen if one of the tokens that Shopin holds undergoes a fork, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin did? (Tokenomics)",
        "answer": "Shopin is a Federated Permissioned-based Blockchain. This fork can never occur since Shopin has contracts with the retailers who are members of the Federation and they signed a contract and code of conduct for the Federation. However, Shopin Tokens held on the Ethereum blockchain are subject to hard forks on the Ethereum blockchain, which by definition are out of our control. This means that if you had 10 Shopin Tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and a hard fork is announced, you will get duplicate Shopin Tokens on the new blockchain. However, these new tokens and their value will be determined by the market. Since they will be on a different blockchain, these new Shopin Tokens will be, in essence, valueless. The finite number of Shopin tokens will remain at 1.5BN. So the only tokens eligible for Atomic swaps to the Shopin blockchain are Shopin Tokens on the Ethereum blockchain."
    }, {
        "question": "Will there be any external audits for the code? (Tokenomics)",
        "answer": "Our partners for auditing are: Hosho, ICORating, and others. We are committed to ensuring the security and validity of our contract."

        "question": "Can I buy Shopin Tokens on a cryptocurrency exchange like Bittrex, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.? (Tokenomics)",
        "answer": "Due to SEC guidance, we cannot discuss exchanges. However, we have been approached by a few of the big ones and some of our participants are approaching exchanges as well."
    }, {
        "question": "Is the Shopin Token a utility token or a security token? (Tokenomics)",
        "answer": "The Shopin Token is a utility token. As a means of exchange between shoppers and retailers, it provides a frictionless form of exchange between shoppers and retailers for incentives and sales promotions from participating retailers. "
    }, {
        "question": "Does Shopin plan to buy back any tokens? (Tokenomics)",
        "answer": "Part of Shopin's business model is to continuously purchase Shopin Tokens from the exchange on behalf of retailers and to kick-start the utility economy. For initial partners, we will be spending half the value of their contract on purchasing tokens from the exchange, given at no cost to use as promotional and loyalty incentives tools for their customers."
    }, {
        "question": "Do you have bounty program? (Tokenomics)",

    }, {
        "question": "How can I exit from the Shopin Token? (Tokenomics)",

    }, {
        "question": "Will participants be selling their Shopin Tokens from their country of origin? (Tokenomics)",
        "answer": "A participant in the Public Token Sale can sell from anywhere in the world as long as the exchange supports residents of that specific country. Participants can sell on the US, Chinese, Korean exchanges as long as the participants are allowed to have an account at that exchange based on each exchange’s terms and conditions, including a list of countries they can do business with. The Know-Your-Customer verification process at the exchange will determine eligibility."
    }, {
        "question": "Will participants get cash for selling Shopin Tokens on the exchange? (Tokenomics)",
        "answer": "At any given exchange of their choosing, they can get cash for the sale of their tokens. Alternatively, they can store their tokens in the Shopin App (or any other ERC20-compatible wallet). Once the Shopin Retail Network is up, a participant will be able to redeem the Shopin Tokens at participating retailers as well."
    }, {
        "question": "Which exchange is Shopin planning to register with? (Tokenomics)",

    }, {
        "question": "How will you ensure user privacy? (Security)",
        "answer": "All user information is encrypted in their wallet. This means that Shopin only has wallet addresses, and only when the Shopin user grants Shopin permission will we know their name."
    }, {
        "question": "I got an email/private message from someone at Shopin but didn't request help. Is that really you? (Security)",
        "answer": "During the Public Token Sale, you will only receive token sale information via an official shopin email address (@shopin.com). If you requested help, you will be assigned a ticket number that corresponds with your original request or question."
    }, {
        "question": "Do you store the data on something like IPFS and not on the phone? (Security)",
        "answer": "Shopin does not store the data on IPFS or outside of our Shopin blockchain or on a user phone. We store the value and data on a Permissioned and Federated Blockchain in an encrypted fashion. "
    }, {
        "question": "Is IPFS a secure solution? (Security)",
        "answer": "It's not relevant for Shopin, since we are not using it."
    }, {
        "question": "How do you plan to store and recover the encryption key(s) for the data? (Security)",
        "answer": "This is Shopin's user responsibility: A Shopin user is advised to use a multi-sig wallet, employing a minimum of three keys. Shopin has one key, one is stored by a third party, and a Shopin user has a key. In order for a Shopin user to interact with their wallet, they will have a Shopin key. If they lose their key, they will have to verify themselves with a third party like CIVIC, which will post an identity authentication and will request access to the wallet from Shopin. This will allow Shopin to generate an additional key and provide that key to the user who will use it to create a new key. To be clear, Shopin cannot access the wallet alone. It requires a second key released by the third party, in this case CIVIC, to allow the Shopin user to access their wallet, destroy the existing key, and generate a new key."
